   - This Machine learning project focuses on predicting the credibility of the customers or subjects for loanrepaymentby analysing differentfactorswhich determine the decission on whether to approve or reject the customer request.
   - The modelling is performed using techniques which as:
      - Encoding.
      - Feature Selection and Ranking.
      - Hyper parameter tuning.
      - Modeling (K-NN, Decission Tree, Gaussian Navie-Bayes)
   - Acheved an average model accuracy of 79% across all the models in <mark>Python</mark>(Jupyter, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
