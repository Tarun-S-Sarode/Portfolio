   - This Machine learning project focuses on predicting the credibility of the customers or subjects for loanrepaymentby analysing differentfactorswhich determine the decission on whether to approve or reject the customer request.
   - The modelling is performed using techniques which as:
       - Encoding 
       - Feature Selection and Ranking 
       - Hyper parameter tuning 
       - Modeling (K-NN, Decision Tree, Gaussian Navie-Bayes)
   
   - Acheved an average model accuracy of 79% across all the models.

   - This project is an exploratory analysis of
        1. Chemical Components in Marijuana. 
        2. Socio Economic Variables.
        3. Fake and Genuine Bank Notes.
   - The analysis gives insight into the relation between the variables of the data sets by using multivariate techniques as Principal Component, Factor Analysis and Discriminant Analysis.
   - The analysis was carried out using SAS

   - Predicted the Bitcoin Prices for the future 10 days of the Time series data.
   - Applied Time Series Analysis techniques like ARIMA, SARIMA, GARCH and Residual Analysis to obtain MASE Table for accuracy.
   - Used R to acurately forecast the future values along with plot.
