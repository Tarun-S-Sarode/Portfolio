   - This Machine learning project focuses on predicting the credibility of the customers or subjects for loanrepaymentby analysing differentfactorswhich determine the decission on whether to approve or reject the customer request.
   - The modelling is performed using techniques which as:
     = Encoding.
     -- Feature Selection and Ranking.
     > Hyper parameter tuning.
     - Modeling (K-NN, Decission Tree, Gaussian Navie-Bayes)
   - Acheved an average model accuracy of 79% across all the models in <mark>Python</mark>(Jupyter, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn).

   - This project is an exploratory analysis of
        1. Chemical Components in Marijuana. 
        2. Socio Economic Variables.
        3. Fake and Genuine Bank Notes.
   - The analysis gives insight into the relation between the variables of the data sets by using multivariate techniques as Principal Component, Factor Analysis and Discriminant Analysis.
   - The analysis was carried out using <mark>SAS</mark>
