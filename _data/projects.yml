   - This Machine learning project focuses on predicting the credibility of the customers or subjects for loan repayment by analysing different factors which determine the decision on whether to approve or reject the customer request.
   - The modelling is performed using techniques which as: Encoding.
     Feature Selection and Ranking.
     Hyperparameter tuning.
     Modelling (K-NN, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive-Bayes)
   - Achieved an average model accuracy of 79% across all the models in <mark>Python</mark>(Jupyter, pandas, NumPy, sci-kit-learn).

   - This is an analysis of how adults manage their finances which are measured from the indicators such as Education, Savings, Borrowings, Expenses, etc.
   - The inferences from the analysis were.
      1. People have the habit of saving when compared to borrowing money.
      2. People dropped out after secondary education when government assistance was provided.
      3. People who have tertiary education had higher salaries.  
   - The analysis was carried out in <mark>SAS</mark>
